My work as Data Services Graduate Assistant at the [GIS and Data Lab](https://umd-gis-data-lab.github.io/) at the University of Maryland Libraries include teaching technical workshops on data science topics viz, Introduction to Python, Data Wrangling with Python, Machine Learning with Python, Introduction to SQL, and Data Visualization with Tableau. Besides teaching workshops, in my role, I give consultations to faculty, graduate students, and research scholars on data science methods to aid their research work.
