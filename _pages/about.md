I'm CS graduate student at the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland, College Park</a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" target="_blank">Tom Goldstein</a>. 

My research interests include making machine learning secure, robust, and fair. Before graduate school, I worked in the industry for 5 years in machine learning and data science roles. I hold a bachelor's degree in mathematics.

I'm looking for a research internship for summer 2024. If you are looking to hire an intern, please hit me up!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
